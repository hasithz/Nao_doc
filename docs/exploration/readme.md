# exploration

Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) refers to the process of an agent learning about its environment by trying out different actions. Exploration is important because it allows the agent to discover new states and actions that may lead to higher rewards. Without exploration, an agent may become stuck in a suboptimal policy and fail to achieve the maximum possible reward.

There are several exploration techniques used in RL, including:

- Epsilon-greedy: This technique involves selecting a random action with a probability of epsilon, and selecting the action with the highest estimated value with a probability of 1-epsilon. This allows the agent to continue to explore even after it has learned a good policy, by occasionally trying out actions that it has not yet tried.

- Softmax action selection: This technique selects actions according to a probability distribution based on the estimated values. It assigns higher probability to actions with higher estimated values, but still allows for exploration by giving some probability to lower-valued actions.

- Boltzmann exploration: This technique selects actions according to a probability distribution based on the estimated values and a temperature parameter. The temperature controls the degree of exploration by determining how much the agent values exploration over exploitation.

- Count-based exploration: This technique is based on the idea that actions that have been visited less frequently are more likely to lead to high-reward states and therefore should be given a higher probability of selection.

- Bayesian Exploration: This technique is based on the idea that the agent learns a prior on the rewards of actions and use it to balance exploration and exploitation.

Intrinsic motivation: This technique is based on the idea that the agent has some internal motivation to explore the environment, rather than relying solely on the external rewards.

Which technique to use depends on the specific problem and the requirements of the agent. It's also possible to combine multiple techniques to get better results.

## Epsilon-greedy

Epsilon-greedy is a popular exploration technique used in reinforcement learning (RL). The idea behind epsilon-greedy is that the agent should continue to explore even after it has learned a good policy, by occasionally trying out actions that it has not yet tried. The technique involves selecting a random action with a probability of epsilon, and selecting the action with the highest estimated value with a probability of 1-epsilon.

The epsilon parameter is a hyperparameter that controls the degree of exploration. A high value of epsilon means that the agent is more likely to select a random action, and a low value of epsilon means that the agent is more likely to select the action with the highest estimated value.

One of the key benefits of epsilon-greedy is that it is simple to implement and easy to understand. It also works well in practice for a wide range of RL problems. However, one of its limitations is that it does not take into account the uncertainty of the estimated values, which can lead to suboptimal exploration.

Epsilon-greedy is a popular exploration technique, and is often used as a starting point for developing more sophisticated exploration strategies. It is also often used in combination with other techniques such as softmax action selection, count-based

### usage

A common strategy is to start with a high epsilon value and decrease it over time as the agent becomes more confident in its estimates. This is known as a decreasing epsilon-greedy strategy. This allows the agent to explore more during the early stages of learning and gradually shift towards exploitation as it becomes more confident in its estimates.

Another strategy is to use adaptive epsilon, which adjusts the epsilon value based on the agent's performance. For example, if the agent is not making significant progress, the epsilon value could be increased to encourage more exploration. Conversely, if the agent is making good progress, the epsilon value could be decreased to focus more on exploitation.

It's worth noting that epsilon-greedy is a good exploration strategy when the action space is discrete, but when the action space is continuous, other exploration strategy should be considered such as adding Gaussian noise to the action.

In summary, epsilon-greedy is a simple and effective exploration technique that allows the agent to continue exploring even after it has learned a good policy. It can be used alone or in combination with other exploration techniques, and its effectiveness can be improved by using a decreasing or adaptive epsilon strategy.

### code 

Epsilon-greedy can be implemented in Python as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

# define the epsilon parameter
epsilon = 0.1

# get the estimated values of all actions
estimated_values = ...

# select a random action with probability epsilon
if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
    action = np.random.randint(len(estimated_values))
# otherwise, select the action with the highest estimated value
else:
    action = np.argmax(estimated_values)

```

In this example, estimated_values is an array containing the estimated values of all actions. The agent selects a random action with probability epsilon, and selects the action with the highest estimated value with probability 1-epsilon.

You can also use a decreasing epsilon strategy by decreasing epsilon over time. For example, you could start with a high epsilon value (e.g., 0.9) and decrease it by a small amount (e.g., 0.001) at each step:


```python
epsilon = 0.9
for i in range(num_steps):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        action = np.random.randint(len(estimated_values))
    else:
        action = np.argmax(estimated_values)
    epsilon -= 0.001


```

Or you can use an adaptive epsilon strategy by adjusting the epsilon value based on the agent's performance.

```python
epsilon = 0.9
for i in range(num_steps):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        action = np.random.randint(len(estimated_values))
    else:
        action = np.argmax(estimated_values)
    if agent_performance < threshold:
        epsilon += 0.01
    else:
        epsilon -= 0.01

```

It's worth noting that this is a basic example and you should adjust the code according to your specific problem and requirements.

### best to use in 

Epsilon-greedy is a simple and effective exploration technique that can be used in a wide range of reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios. Some of the best scenarios for using epsilon-greedy include:

- Discrete action spaces: Epsilon-greedy is well-suited for problems with a discrete action space, where there are a finite number of actions that the agent can take. This is because epsilon-greedy selects actions by comparing their estimated values and choosing the action with the highest value or a random action.

- Balanced exploration-exploitation: Epsilon-greedy is a good choice when the goal is to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. By controlling the epsilon parameter, you can control the degree of exploration and exploitation, making it easy to adjust the trade-off between the two.

- Simple problems: Epsilon-greedy is a good starting point for simple problems, as it is easy to implement and understand. It can also be used as a baseline for more complex problems, to compare the performance of other exploration methods.

- Multi-armed bandits: Epsilon-greedy is a popular method for solving multi-armed bandit problems, where the goal is to select the best arm from a set of arms with unknown rewards.

- Game playing : Epsilon-greedy is also used to play games, where the agent starts by exploring the game and gradually shifts towards exploiting the knowledge it has acquired.

Epsilon-greedy is not the best choice in some scenario such as when the action space is continuous, or when the agent needs to learn about the true uncertainty of the environment. In this case, other exploration techniques such as adding Gaussian noise to the action or more sophisticated exploration methods like Bayesian exploration would be more appropriate.
