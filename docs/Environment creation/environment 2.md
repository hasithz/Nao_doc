# Nao Basic Environment

The concept is to identify the best possible action by looking at the test subject.
The goal is to keep the engagement with with test subject all the time and ask the best suitable question from the test subject in order to maximize the attention.

there are 5 sets of state sets and in a state set there are 4 states. each state set represent a different question and based on the observation the action must be choose from set current state set or from the next state set. 

as for the demonstration purpose we have created these steps as in a way of representing,

- find child
- name calling 
- with whom did you come
- asking for the favorite color
- picture showing
- final state

and as for the observations we have stated with 3 main parameters 
- gaze
- distance
- task completion 

and the task completion was divided into 4 pars as well
- well finished with the 100% expectance 
- gave an answer with a yes or no by verbally or competed the task with near accuracy of 75%
- answer was given through head nodding or poorly conducted bellow 50%
- task was never completed at all or never tried to complete it
