in DQN network as for the sequential layers 

> inputs -> 16
    activation relu
    linear 16 -> 16
    activation relu
    output 16 -> num actions

# observation 
the q value mean was a constant and in a stable position 

# conclusion 
as for the control state i've removed the exploration by removing the epsilon 

because of this in order to be stabilize the model it chooses to do nothing at all and this is a good example where exploration was removed and network is not enough to determine a stable position. 


this experiment was a failed 

next is to introduce the epsilon and see how it performs

### tasks to do
- [x] add a player where it generates random values with no probability to indicate a autistic behavior 
- [x] when feeding players into the environment introduce them one by one 
    - for example introduce medium player first and run the environment for 10000 steps and then add another player where it has similar features like the player introduced at the beginning and now the environment has 2 players and again run it for like 10000 steps and so on introduce other players as well to the environment.
- [ ] add more state sets to the world where the model can freely move more on the environment.

### problems accord during the process
    adding all the problems accord during the process 
    players were added when there is a reset on the environment. and a player was added every 100000 steps.

### interesting things saw during the process 
    player feeding was done in 2 different ways,

- average type of 3 players in the beginning and then the 3 types of best players and last the low type players 
- best 3 players first and then the average and finally the low players 

### observation 1
when feeding average players first
