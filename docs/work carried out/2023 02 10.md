## stacking multiple GRU and introducing batches with sequences

Last time I just introduced only with a single batch with 25 sequential steps and 8 input observations. Now as for the update increased the batch size up to 10 and ran the process. It's much more slower process since it has more data to process but the results are good and the overall reward is high and it can identify a path where the reward is positive.
