### implementing GRU network 

The idea is to develop a simple GRU network. And construct the agent. As for the basic implementation a single GRU cell network was used in Actor Critic.

Now in here using this model, there are few key things we can see that the step count has been stabilized, but when considering the results it is clear that the model has trained on getting it to the next end of the states where it will be rewarded 25 in the end. So even though for the high players a slight improvement was captured when introduced other players, the variation on the reward plot got bigger and effect the whole model.
