# Actor Critic 

## Deference between DQN and Actor Critic 

Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Actor-Critic (AC) are two popular reinforcement learning algorithms that have been used to train artificial agents to perform tasks in a variety of environments.

DQN is a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to approximate the optimal action-value function. It does so by using a deep neural network to represent the function, hence the name "Deep Q-Network." The model uses a replay buffer to store experiences, which are sampled and used to update the network's weights. The goal of the model is to maximize the expected cumulative reward over time by choosing the action with the highest Q-value.

On the other hand, the Actor-Critic model is a policy-based reinforcement learning algorithm. It consists of two separate components: the actor and the critic. The actor is responsible for choosing actions, while the critic evaluates the value of the actions taken by the actor. The critic provides feedback to the actor, which then updates its policy to better approximate the optimal policy. The goal of the Actor-Critic model is to maximize the expected cumulative reward over time by improving the policy through interaction with the environment.

In summary, the main difference between DQN and Actor-Critic models is that DQN is a value-based algorithm that learns to approximate the optimal action-value function, while the Actor-Critic is a policy-based algorithm that consists of two separate components, the actor and the critic, which work together to improve the policy.

## AC, A2C, A3C

Actor-Critic (AC), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) are all reinforcement learning algorithms that belong to the Actor-Critic family of algorithms. The main difference between these algorithms lies in the number of agents and the level of parallelism used in the training process.

The Actor-Critic algorithm consists of two separate components: the actor and the critic. The actor is responsible for choosing actions, while the critic evaluates the value of the actions taken by the actor. The critic provides feedback to the actor, which then updates its policy to better approximate the optimal policy.

Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) is an extension of the Actor-Critic algorithm that uses multiple parallel agents to learn from different environments in parallel. This allows for faster convergence and better exploration, as the agents can learn from a variety of experiences.

Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) is another extension of the Actor-Critic algorithm that also uses multiple parallel agents. The difference between A2C and A3C lies in the level of parallelism used in the training process. In A3C, each agent operates asynchronously and independently, allowing for even more parallelism and faster convergence.

In summary, the main difference between Actor-Critic, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) lies in the number of agents and the level of parallelism used in the training process. AC uses a single agent, A2C uses multiple parallel agents, and A3C uses multiple asynchronous and independent agents for parallel training.

### using DQNs in AC

In this setup, the critic component of the Actor-Critic algorithm would be represented by a DQN network, which would estimate the action-value function. The actor component would then use the estimates from the critic to update its policy, as in a traditional Actor-Critic algorithm.

This combination of DQN and Actor-Critic algorithms has been shown to be effective in a variety of environments and tasks. By combining the strengths of both algorithms, such as the stability and accuracy of DQN and the sample efficiency and policy-based nature of Actor-Critic, this hybrid approach can lead to improved performance and faster convergence.

In conclusion, using a DQN network in an Actor-Critic algorithm is possible and can lead to improved performance. This hybrid approach takes advantage of the strengths of both algorithms to achieve better results in reinforcement learning tasks.
